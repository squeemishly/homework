1. How will you know when the problem is solved? (Identify the big-picture goal)
    When I have a functioning software that does what is required of it. Preferably, I will have written code that is efficient as well as effective in the process.

2. How do you want to use the software? (Identify the “interface”)
    In this case, we just want to run it in the terminal. I suppose this could be translated into a terrible text based game that was run in a new window? But that seems pointless...

3. What’s the (next-)most trivial possible case? (Identify the next small-picture goal)
    Start with having the end user being able to interact with the person on the phone. Even if the communication is worse than this particular assignment demands it to be...

4. How do we achieve this goal? (Sketch an algorithm using pseudocode)
    Start with an opening line, something like "This is a grocery store"
    Let the user tell me what their question/statement is
    Based on the user input allow several types of responses:
        If they don't respond at all, shout "Hello" at them
        If they ask a question, tell them that you're having a hard time hearing them
        If they ask a question in all caps, tell them they have not reached a pet store
        The first time they say goodbye, ask if they need help with anything else 
        The second time they say goodbye, thank them for calling and leave the program 

actual code to follow soon

now I see new stuff?
